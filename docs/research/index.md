# Research

## Introduction

In our One-Click Deployment project, we aim to gain a thorough understanding of the OSS deployment and management landscape. This encompasses assessing current challenges and exploring how existing solutions address these issues.

## Competitive Analysis

Our competitive analysis provides insights into both direct competitors and hosted solutions in the OSS deployment space.

### Direct Competitors

- Analyzing solutions like `plural.sh`, focusing on their technological approach and user experience. [More in Competitive Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md)

### Hosted Solutions

- Evaluating platforms such as `reflex.dev` and `streamlit.io`, understanding their service models and user support mechanisms. [Detailed in Hosted Solutions Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md#hosted-solutions)

### Key Differentiators

- Identifying unique aspects of our One-Click Deployment solution compared to these existing services. [See Benefits and Drawbacks](research/state-of-research.md#benefits-and-drawbacks)

## Evaluation Model for OSS Technologies

We follow a structured model to determine which OSS technologies to support, ensuring they align with our platform's capabilities and user needs.

### Criteria for Selection

- Assessing technical compatibility, community support, and maintenance practices. [Criteria Details](research/requirements.md#criteria-for-selection)

### Onboarding Process

- Outlining the process for integrating new OSS technologies into our platform. [Onboarding Steps](research/requirements.md#onboarding-process)

## Target OSS Technologies for Prototype

In "Project 2", we aim to integrate and thoroughly analyze primarly `reflex.dev`.
As we outlined in our [Supported Technologies](../decisions/0004-supported-technologies.md) decision, we will probably also integrate `streamlit.io` and `node-red` if we have time left.

### Reflex.dev

- Investigating its architecture and deployment intricacies. [Reflex.dev Analysis](research/user-stories.md#reflex-dev)

### Streamlit.io (*if time permits*)

- Assessing usability and customization capabilities. [Streamlit.io Insights](research/personas.md#streamlit-io)

### Node-RED (*if time permits*)

- Examining scalability and integration capabilities. [Node-RED Evaluation](research/use-cases.md#node-red)

## Research Questions

Our investigation is guided by critical questions that will shape our understanding and development of the One-Click Deployment platform.
As outlined in our [meeting notes from October 23, 2023](../meetings/2023-10-23.md) these questions include:

### Current Pain Points in Deploying and Managing OSS

- Understanding the challenges users currently face, as detailed in [User Stories](research/user-stories.md) and [Personas](research/personas.md).

### Offerings of Existing Solutions

- How do current solutions, including hyperscalers and specific platforms like `plural.sh`, address these challenges? [Competitive Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md)

### Gaps in Current Offerings

- Identifying unaddressed needs and potential areas of improvement. [State of Research](research/state-of-research.md#gaps-in-current-offerings)

### Differentiation of Our Solution

- Articulating the unique value proposition of our system. [Benefits and Unique Features](docs/backend.md#differentiation)

Our approach includes surveys, case studies, and hands-on testing of various OSS frameworks, ensuring a well-rounded and comprehensive research output.

## Methods

In executing this project, we employ a variety of methodologies and tools to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and innovation.

### Utilizing AI for Project Development

Our project heavily relies on advanced AI tools, namely ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot, to streamline various aspects of the development process.
This decision is detailed in our [Use of Generative AI](../decisions/0005-use-of-generative-ai.md) decision.

#### ChatGPT

- **Content Structuring**: ChatGPT assists in organizing and structuring the vast content of our project, ensuring clarity and coherence in our documentation.
- **Topic Definition**: We use ChatGPT to define and refine the key topics and questions that our research should address.
- **Project Guidance**: ChatGPT serves as a virtual collaborator, providing suggestions, answering queries, and offering insights that guide the project's progression.

#### Microsoft CoPilot

- **Prototype Development**: CoPilot is instrumental in the coding process, helping to write, review, and debug code for our prototype.
- **Efficient Coding**: By leveraging CoPilotâ€™s AI capabilities, we can develop code more efficiently, reducing the time spent on routine coding tasks.
- **Solution Exploration**: CoPilot aids in exploring various coding solutions and approaches, enhancing the creative process of developing our One-Click Deployment system.

### Traditional Research Methods

Alongside these AI tools, we continue to employ traditional research methods such as surveys, user interviews, and case studies for comprehensive data collection and analysis.

Our approach combines the strengths of advanced AI technology with conventional research methodologies, setting a benchmark for innovative research and development in the field of OSS deployment.
