# Research

## Introduction

In our One-Click Deployment project, we aim to gain a thorough understanding of the OSS deployment and management landscape. This encompasses assessing current challenges and exploring how existing solutions address these issues.

## Competitive Analysis

Our competitive analysis provides insights into both direct competitors and hosted solutions in the OSS deployment space.

### Direct Competitors

- Analyzing solutions like `plural.sh`, focusing on their technological approach and user experience. [More in Competitive Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md)

### Hosted Solutions

- Evaluating platforms such as `reflex.dev` and `streamlit.io`, understanding their service models and user support mechanisms. [Detailed in Hosted Solutions Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md#hosted-solutions)

### Key Differentiators

- Identifying unique aspects of our One-Click Deployment solution compared to these existing services. [See Benefits and Drawbacks](research/state-of-research.md#benefits-and-drawbacks)

## Evaluation Model for OSS Technologies

We follow a structured model to determine which OSS technologies to support, ensuring they align with our platform's capabilities and user needs.

### Criteria for Selection

- Assessing technical compatibility, community support, and maintenance practices. [Criteria Details](research/requirements.md#criteria-for-selection)

### Onboarding Process

- Outlining the process for integrating new OSS technologies into our platform. [Onboarding Steps](research/requirements.md#onboarding-process)

## Target OSS Technologies for Prototype

In "Project 2", we aim to integrate and thoroughly analyze primarly `reflex.dev`.
As we outlined in our [Supported Technologies](../decisions/0004-supported-technologies.md) decision, we will probably also integrate `streamlit.io` and `node-red` if we have time left.

### Reflex.dev

- Investigating its architecture and deployment intricacies. [Reflex.dev Analysis](research/user-stories.md#reflex-dev)

### Streamlit.io (*if time permits*)

- Assessing usability and customization capabilities. [Streamlit.io Insights](research/personas.md#streamlit-io)

### Node-RED (*if time permits*)

- Examining scalability and integration capabilities. [Node-RED Evaluation](research/use-cases.md#node-red)

## Research Questions

Our investigation is guided by critical questions that will shape our understanding and development of the One-Click Deployment platform.
As outlined in our [meeting notes from October 23, 2023](../meetings/2023-10-23.md) these questions include:

### Current Pain Points in Deploying and Managing OSS

- Understanding the challenges users currently face, as detailed in [User Stories](research/user-stories.md) and [Personas](research/personas.md).

### Offerings of Existing Solutions

- How do current solutions, including hyperscalers and specific platforms like `plural.sh`, address these challenges? [Competitive Analysis](research/competitive-analysis.md)

### Gaps in Current Offerings

- Identifying unaddressed needs and potential areas of improvement. [State of Research](research/state-of-research.md#gaps-in-current-offerings)

### Differentiation of Our Solution

- Articulating the unique value proposition of our system. [Benefits and Unique Features](docs/backend.md#differentiation)

Our approach includes surveys, case studies, and hands-on testing of various OSS frameworks, ensuring a well-rounded and comprehensive research output.
