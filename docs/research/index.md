# Research

## Introduction

In our One-Click Deployment project, we aim to thoroughly understand the OSS deployment and management landscape, focusing on both OSS frameworks and pre-built applications.

## Competitive Analysis

Our competitive analysis explores the landscape of OSS deployment, distinguishing between frameworks and applications.

### OSS Frameworks

- Examining solutions like `reflex.dev` and `streamlit.io`, focusing on their use as frameworks to build applications. [Reflex Analysis](./competitive-analysis/reflex-hosting.md) | [Streamlit.io Analysis](./competitive-analysis/streamlit-cloud.md)

### Pre-Built Applications

- Evaluating pre-built applications like `Node-RED`, which offer ready-to-use functionality. [Application Analysis](./competitive-analysis/kaa-node-red-hosting.md)

### Hyperscalers

- Analyzing how hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and GCP provide managed OSS services and comparing their offerings to our solution. [Hyperscaler Analysis](./competitive-analysis/hyperscalers.md)

## Evaluation Model for OSS Technologies

Our model distinguishes between frameworks and applications in terms of their deployment and management needs.

### Selection Criteria

- Criteria specific to frameworks and applications, considering their unique deployment and operational requirements. [Criteria Details](./requirements.md)

### Onboarding Process

- Steps for integrating frameworks and applications into our platform, taking into account their different natures. [Onboarding Steps](./requirements.md)

## Target OSS Technologies for Prototype

"Project 2" focuses on integrating technologies that represent both OSS frameworks and applications.

### Reflex.dev

- A deep dive into deploying and managing Reflex.dev as a framework. [Reflex.dev Analysis](research/user-stories.md#reflex-dev)

### Streamlit.io

- Understanding Streamlit.io's deployment process as a framework. [Streamlit.io Insights](research/personas.md#streamlit-io)

### Node-RED

- Evaluating Node-RED's use case as a pre-built application. [Node-RED Evaluation](research/use-cases.md#node-red)

## Research Questions

Our investigation is guided by critical questions that will shape our understanding and development of the One-Click Deployment platform.
As outlined in our [meeting notes from October 23, 2023](../meetings/2023-10-23.md) these questions include:

### Current Pain Points in Deploying and Managing OSS

- Understanding the challenges users currently face, as detailed in [User Stories](./user-stories.md) and [Personas](./personas.md).

### Offerings of Existing Solutions

- How do current solutions, including hyperscalers and specific platforms like `plural.sh`, address these challenges? [Competitive Analysis](./competitive-analysis/plural.md)

### Gaps in Current Offerings

- Identifying unaddressed needs and potential areas of improvement. [State of Research](./state-of-research.md)

### Differentiation of Our Solution

- Articulating the unique value proposition of our system. [Benefits and Unique Features](./requirements.md)

## Methods

In executing this project, we employ a variety of methodologies and tools to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and innovation.

### Utilizing AI for Project Development

Our project heavily relies on advanced AI tools, namely ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot, to streamline various aspects of the development process.
This decision is detailed in our [Use of Generative AI](../decisions/0005-use-of-generative-ai.md) decision.

#### ChatGPT

- **Content Structuring**: ChatGPT assists in organizing and structuring the vast content of our project, ensuring clarity and coherence in our documentation.
- **Topic Definition**: We use ChatGPT to define and refine the key topics and questions that our research should address.
- **Project Guidance**: ChatGPT serves as a virtual collaborator, providing suggestions, answering queries, and offering insights that guide the project's progression.

#### Microsoft CoPilot

- **Prototype Development**: CoPilot is instrumental in the coding process, helping to write, review, and debug code for our prototype.
- **Efficient Coding**: By leveraging CoPilotâ€™s AI capabilities, we can develop code more efficiently, reducing the time spent on routine coding tasks.
- **Solution Exploration**: CoPilot aids in exploring various coding solutions and approaches, enhancing the creative process of developing our One-Click Deployment system.

### Traditional Research Methods

Alongside these AI tools, we continue to employ traditional research methods such as surveys, user interviews, and case studies for comprehensive data collection and analysis.

Our approach combines the strengths of advanced AI technology with conventional research methodologies, setting a benchmark for innovative research and development in the field of OSS deployment.
