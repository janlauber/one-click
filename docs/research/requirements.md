# Requirements for One-Click Deployment Solution

## Overview

This document outlines the essential requirements for the One-Click Deployment solution, designed to support a diverse range of OSS technologies, including frameworks and ready-to-use applications.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Compatibility

- **Framework Support (e.g., reflex.dev, streamlit.io, gradio.app, anvil.works, plotly.com)**:
  - Ability to deploy and manage web app frameworks.
  - Support for necessary runtime environments and dependencies.
  - Must be able to Dockerize the framework.

!!! note

    Applications are excluded from the prototype. See [ADR 0006](../decisions/0006-applications-exclusion.md) for more details.

- **Application Support (e.g., Node-RED, JupyterHub)** (excluded from the prototype):
  - Capability to deploy SaaS-like applications with pre-configured settings.
  - Integration options for external APIs and services.
  - There should be a helm chart available for the application.

### 2. Scalability

- Ability to scale resources based on the specific needs of the OSS technology, whether it's a lightweight framework or a comprehensive application.

### 3. Security

- Implement security measures appropriate to the type of OSS technology, considering data isolation, API security, and user authentication.

## User Requirements

### 1. User Interface (UI)

- Adaptive UI that caters to both frameworks and applications, providing tailored dashboards and control panels.

### 2. Customization and Configuration

- Flexible configuration options for frameworks, allowing developers to define runtime environments, dependencies, and other settings.
- Pre-configured templates for applications, with options for customization as per user requirements.

## Compliance and Standards

### 1. Open-Source Compliance

- Ensure compliance with the varying licenses and usage terms of different OSS technologies.

## Future-Proofing

### 1. Extensibility and Adaptability

- Design the system to adapt to the evolving nature of different OSS technologies, be it frameworks or fully-fledged applications.

## Specific Considerations

### 1. Frameworks vs. Applications

- Develop distinct deployment strategies and support mechanisms for frameworks and ready-to-use applications, acknowledging their unique operational requirements.

### 2. Resource Allocation

- Implement dynamic resource allocation strategies that cater to the varying demands of frameworks and applications.
