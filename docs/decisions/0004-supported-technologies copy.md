# Supported Technologies

Date: 17.11.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide the supported technologies for the prototype.

## Decision

We will use the following technologies:

- Reflex: <https://reflex.dev>
  - We will use Reflex for the prototype, because it is a very interesting technology and we want to learn more about it. Also it is very easy to use and has a lot of features.

If we have time left we will also integrate the following technologies:

- Streamlit: <https://streamlit.io>
  - We will use Streamlit for the prototype, because it is a very interesting technology and we want to learn more about it. Also it is very easy to use and has a lot of features.
- Node-RED: <https://nodered.org>
  - We will use Node-RED for the prototype, because it is a very interesting technology and we want to learn more about it. Also it is very easy to use and has a lot of features.

## Consequences

Because of choosing these technologies we will have a prototype of the web application in a short amount of time.
