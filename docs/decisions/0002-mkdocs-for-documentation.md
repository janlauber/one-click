# 0001 MKDocs for documentation

Date: 30.10.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to use a static site generator for the documentation of this project. I have heard good things about MKDocs, so I want to try it out.
The documentation should be versioned with the code, so it should be in the same repository.

## Decision

I will use MKDocs for the documentation of this project.

## Consequences

The documentation will be versioned with the code.
