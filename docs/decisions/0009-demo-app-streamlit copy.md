## Status

Accepted

## Context

We try to build a demo app on a certain framework to show the capabilities of one-click. We need to decide which framework we will use:

- [Reflex.dev](https://reflex.dev/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)

## Decision

I've tried all three frameworks and I think Streamlit is the best choice for our demo app. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. It is also easy to deploy and has a lot of integrations.
Also the build process of the Docker image is very easy. The demo app will be a reporting tool which we will use in our company.

## Consequences

Now we can start to build the demo app on Streamlit. We can also start to build the Docker image for the demo app.
