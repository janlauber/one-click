# Use of Generative AI

Date: 17.11.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For research, content structuring, project guidance, and efficient development, we will use advanced AI tools.

## Decision

We will use the following tools:

- ChatGPT: <https://chatgpt.com>
  - We will use ChatGPT for content structuring, topic definition, and project guidance, because it is a very interesting technology and we want to learn more about it. Also it is very easy to use and has a lot of features.
- Microsoft CoPilot: <https://copilot.github.com>
  - We will use CoPilot for prototype development, efficient coding, and solution exploration, because it is a very interesting technology and we want to learn more about it. Also it is very easy to use and has a lot of features.

## Consequences

Because of choosing these technologies we will have a prototype of the web application in a short amount of time.
Also the documentation will gain a lot of quality and will be easier to understand.
For us it will be easier to develop the prototype and we will have more time to focus on the research.
