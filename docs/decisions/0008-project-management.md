# Project Management

Date: 19.11.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To manage our tasks we need to decide which project management tool we will use. The tool should be able to manage the tasks. It should be able to create, update and delete the tasks. It should also be able to assign the tasks to the team members.

## Decision

We will use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/janlauber/projects/1/views/1) to manage our tasks. GitHub Projects will be able to manage the tasks. It will be able to create, update and delete the tasks. It will also be able to assign the tasks to the team members.

## Consequences

Now we can collect all tasks in one place which makes it easier to prioritize features, documentations and decisions. We can also assign tasks to team members which makes it easier to see who is working on which task.
