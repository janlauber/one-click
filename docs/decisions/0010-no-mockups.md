# Project Management

Date: 16.12.2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to get the prototype ready for the end of the project. We don't have a lot of time to design mockups in figma.

## Decision

We won't use mockups to build the whole frontend of the prototype.

## Consequences

We will build the prototype without mockups to save time and prevent us from getting stuck in the design process.
In the following up bachelor thesis we will get some feedback from users and improve the design and UX of the prototype.
