# One-Click Deployment

Over the past few decades, open-source software (OSS) has emerged as a transformative force in the tech ecosystem, empowering end-users with a gamut of applications that are both economically viable and customizable. However, the complexity involved in setting up, deploying, and managing these OSS tools can deter many potential users. While hyperscalers have addressed the issue of customers not wanting to own hardware, the issue of effectively operating OSS remains unaddressed.

This situation not only increases the overhead for businesses but can also slow down adaptation and implementation of potentially transformative tools.
