## Abstract

The One-Click Deployment project is an innovative initiative designed to revolutionize the way open-source software (OSS) is deployed and managed. In a technological landscape where OSS plays a pivotal role, the complexity of deployment and management often poses significant barriers to adoption. Our solution aims to address these challenges by introducing a streamlined, user-friendly platform that simplifies the entire deployment process.

At the heart of this project is the development of a unified platform that caters to two distinct types of OSS technologies: `frameworks` and `applications`. Frameworks, such as reflex.dev and streamlit.io, are used to build custom applications and require specific handling, including Dockerization and integration with image registries. On the other hand, pre-built applications like Node-RED come with their configurations and deployment methodologies, often utilizing Helm charts.

The One-Click Deployment system leverages cutting-edge technologies like Kubernetes for container orchestration, Helm for package management, and Golang for backend programming. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and compatible with a variety of cloud environments and operating systems. The platform not only reduces the technical burden on developers and DevOps teams but also democratizes access to advanced OSS tools, enabling businesses and individual developers to harness the full potential of open-source solutions.

This project stands at the forefront of OSS deployment innovation, providing a bridge between the rich world of open-source tools and the diverse needs of its users. Through comprehensive research, strategic decision-making, and meticulous development, One-Click Deployment is poised to become a key enabler in the widespread adoption and efficient utilization of open-source software.

## Introduction

### Current Situation

Open-source software (OSS) has profoundly impacted the tech ecosystem over the past few decades, offering applications that are both economically viable and highly customizable. However, the complexity of deploying and managing these tools poses a significant barrier to many users. While hyperscalers have addressed hardware ownership concerns, operating OSS effectively remains a challenge. The responsibility of deployment and maintenance often falls on internal development and operations teams, adding overhead and slowing the adaptation of transformative OSS tools.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge lies in the complexity of deploying and managing OSS. Tasks such as setup, configuration, updates, and troubleshooting require specialized skills, which may not be readily available in-house. Furthermore, the 'as-a-service' model's applicability is limited, with certain applications facing compatibility issues due to unique operational requirements. This highlights the need for a solution that simplifies and democratizes OSS deployment.

### Objectives

Our goal is to develop a methodology, supported by a technical solution, to simplify the deployment and management of OSS. Specifically, the One-Click Deployment system aims to abstract complexities, standardize deployment procedures, and deliver OSS 'as-a-service'. This initiative seeks to address the barriers in OSS adoption, making it more accessible and manageable for a diverse user base.

### Methodological Approach

Our approach leverages existing technologies like Kubernetes, Helm, and Golang to develop a prototype of the One-Click Deployment system. We will analyze the architecture of various OSS technologies, differentiating between frameworks (for building custom applications) and pre-built applications (ready-to-use solutions). The research will guide the development of a robust, scalable, and flexible system that eases the burden on DevOps teams and democratizes access to open-source solutions.

### Understanding OSS Technologies

- **Frameworks**: These are used to build custom applications. The deployment process involves Dockerization and pushing to a Docker image registry before deploying through our platform.
- **Applications**: Pre-built applications like Node-RED have different deployment requirements, often utilizing Helm charts for configuration and deployment.
