## Abstract

*To be determined.*

## Introduction

### Current Situation

Open-source software (OSS) has profoundly impacted the tech ecosystem over the past few decades, offering applications that are both economically viable and highly customizable. However, the complexity of deploying and managing these tools poses a significant barrier to many users. While hyperscalers have addressed hardware ownership concerns, operating OSS effectively remains a challenge. The responsibility of deployment and maintenance often falls on internal development and operations teams, adding overhead and slowing the adaptation of transformative OSS tools.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge lies in the complexity of deploying and managing OSS. Tasks such as setup, configuration, updates, and troubleshooting require specialized skills, which may not be readily available in-house. Furthermore, the 'as-a-service' model's applicability is limited, with certain applications facing compatibility issues due to unique operational requirements. This highlights the need for a solution that simplifies and democratizes OSS deployment.

### Objectives

Our goal is to develop a methodology, supported by a technical solution, to simplify the deployment and management of OSS. Specifically, the One-Click Deployment system aims to abstract complexities, standardize deployment procedures, and deliver OSS 'as-a-service'. This initiative seeks to address the barriers in OSS adoption, making it more accessible and manageable for a diverse user base.

### Methodological Approach

Our approach leverages existing technologies like Kubernetes, Helm, and Golang to develop a prototype of the One-Click Deployment system. We will analyze the architecture of various OSS technologies, differentiating between frameworks (for building custom applications) and pre-built applications (ready-to-use solutions). The research will guide the development of a robust, scalable, and flexible system that eases the burden on DevOps teams and democratizes access to open-source solutions.

### Understanding OSS Technologies

- **Frameworks**: These are used to build custom applications. The deployment process involves Dockerization and pushing to a Docker image registry before deploying through our platform.
- **Applications**: Pre-built applications like Node-RED have different deployment requirements, often utilizing Helm charts for configuration and deployment.
